# Solo-Project for Chingu (Voyage 13)

This was created to join voyage 13 in [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) as a prework project. (i.e. an online tech-community for making collaborative projects with motivated self-learners world-wide.) I cloned a website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) using vanilla HTML/CSS, Javascript and SASS/SCSS.


# Features

- Text typed as a custom text should immediately change the font displayed in each corresponding font cards.
- The font size in each font cards should change according to the selection of font size chooser.
- When 'reset' button is clicked, the page should appear as if the user reloaded the page.
